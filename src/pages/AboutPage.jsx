 <h1>
At MyRun, we believe running is more than a solo journey — it’s a shared adventure. Whether you’re lacing up your shoes for the first time or you’ve been chasing PRs for years, this is a space created just for you.

<h2>
Why intervals matter
</h2>
<h1>
Interval running — mixing shorter bursts of speed with recovery periods — is one of the most powerful tools a runner can use to sharpen performance. It trains your cardiovascular system, challenges your muscles, and increases your speed and endurance in a time-efficient way. 
By working in intervals, you push your limits, then allow your body to recover and adapt, so each subsequent effort becomes stronger. And far from being reserved for elite runners, interval methods can be tailored to every skill level, from beginners to seasoned athletes. 
</h1>
<h1>
On this site, we spotlight ten unique interval running styles — from sprint reps to pyramid sets, hill repeats to tempo intervals — giving you ideas and structure to keep your training fresh, effective, and fun.
Building community through conversation and connection
We know that progress happens not just in the legs, but in the mind — and that’s where community comes in. 
</h1>
<h2>
Here’s how we bring runners together:
</h2>
<h1>
•	Discussions under each interval style: After each style is described, there’s a chat thread where members can ask questions, share experiences, and compare workouts.
•	Member posts, comments & likes: You can create posts — about your training, your challenges, your victories — and engage with others in a supportive space.
•	Personal trainer access: Need help customizing your intervals or tailoring a plan? Connect one-on-one with a certified coach for personalized advice and encouragement.
</h1>
<h2>
We aim to be welcoming, safe, and inclusive. Your pace, your story, your background — none of that matters here. What matters is your heart and your willingness to grow. We uphold respect, encouragement, and kindness as foundational values.
</h2>
<h2>
All runners, all levels, one tribe
</h2>
<h1>
MyRun is made for anyone who runs:
•	New to running and want to explore structure? You're welcome.

</h1>
<h1>
Our goal is to make this your home base for interval ideas, honest conversation, and support. You’ll find workouts you might never have tried — and friends who’ll cheer you on.
So come on in. Browse an interval style, drop a comment, ask a question, or simply read what others are doing. Let’s run, chat, learn, and grow — together.
